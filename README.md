## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [ ] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [x] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [x] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite Scrolling
- [x] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and creation
- [ ] User can use a tab bar to switch between all "Instagram" posts and posts published only by the user.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [ ] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.
- [x] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen.
- [x] Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. We should discuss our understanding of Parse, but more importantly figure out what about Parse confuses us.
2. Discuss common edge cases in Parse applications.
